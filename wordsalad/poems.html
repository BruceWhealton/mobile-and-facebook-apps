  <h3>Michael Brownstein</h3>
  
<pre>one two three four five taxicabs in a line 
one to bite the beast and two to beat the bread—
a carnival of conditions
and I feel better than Chicago —
gunshot city, weather watchers,
complainers and animosity, angst
and mediocrity, gut wrenched trees,
flash drive passions,
four corners, six corners, uptown,
downtown, the park Roger named,
fear seeker, bullet heads,
gray down on the rooftops,
pock marked and feckless,
store glass, white automobiles,
black heads and blemishes,
acne scabbed and oozing,
the train crossing,
pigeons on the platform,
garbage cans. Splinters,
tears, cracks and holes.
 
Silence is afterbirth,
downed wires, downed trees,
a bird's nest with three spilled eggs.

<div data-role="content">  <h2>Another Win: Political Bedfellows</h2>
  <h3>by KJ Hannah Greenberg</h3>
  
<pre>Tenafly, New Jersey’s airport
Pings with presidential hopefuls’
Security detail. Those buzz-cut
Men never suspected that
A fat matron might aim
And fire……
At the next president.
<br />
Rather than showcase
Ambulance footage, the woman
Locked, currently, on the box
Controlling atom smashers,
Laughed like a criminal.
Cleaning up the party
Proved easier than neutering rabbits.
<br />
Only the drug conglomerates sighed
Over losing their walking billboard
For Viagra. At least the rosy-faced
Opposition remained
Addicted to pain narcotics.
Good ‘ol days’ elections denied
Chemical barons of vetting opportunities.
<br />
Former stump and whistle wars
Brought Lincoln, emancipation, carpet bagging.
Whereas Internet, plus instant messaging, yielded
Contrary perceptions.
America’s perceived need for pops and pills
Could still be fanned forever.

Murder makes the vote another win.</pre></div>

Wrapped inside an avenue

a homeless man

hunger gnawing as he

pretends he's part of the

stomach aching

  <h3>by Gary Beck</h3>
<pre>
The man who pits himself against dread time to make some imprint on the book of life is snuffed out briefly, like a short-lived spark and tastes the futile nothingness of death.
Yet death sometimes tastes of defeat,
for in each age for those who died
the living cherish a remembered flame
and memory outlives the tomb.

  <h3>by Scott Urban</h3>
<pre>
An hour and a half after sunrise
only single runners with their Borzois
are on the jogging path.
Grandmother brings the girl to the park
so mom can get an extra hour of sleep.
The girl runs ahead to the swings.
The black rubber seat curves around her rump and the iron links dig into her hips.
She cannot stop touching the tip of her tongue to her top lip.  She is not aware she does this.
She kicks her feet opposite each other.
Grandmother gives a leadoff push, sits on a bench.
The girl throws her head back, squawks like a macaw.
Grandmother waves off the gnats and her eyelids close.
The girl will swing and swing until the other kids arrive.  
Then she will hunch her shoulders, try to cover her ears, shut out the shouting.</pre></div>

<div data-role="content">  <h2>Instant Attraction</h2>
  <h3>by Gary Beck</h3>
<pre>
One brief glance
for a fleeting moment
in a rain-stormed city,
struck with the frenzy
of a mugger’s knife,
gutting the shell
of a concealed heart.
I spilled incoherent words,
like marbles falling from a child’s pocket, tumbling wildly, out of control.
I was possessed by her
and passion gripped me
like insistent hands on an udder.
She jumped into a taxi
frightened or annoyed
and ignored my plea to wait.
I stood helplessly on the sidewalk,
wiping the rain from my face,
too stunned to find shelter
and watched her become
another lost moment. </pre></div>

<div data-role="content">  <h2>Jesse's Homeless Face</h2>
  <h3>by Michael Lee Johnson</h3>
<pre>
Someday Jesse wants to go home.
I see his world,
all it's hidden concepts
embedded in Jesse's aging face-
life has whispered by leaving
memory trails-
wrinkled forehead,
deep as river bed ruts
dried with years, weather-beaten,
just above his bushy eyebrows
that are gray and twisted-
much like life drawing memories
across his empty face.
Jesse has a long oblique
Jewish nose with dark
blue opal eyes,
that would pierce
even the pain
of his own crucifixion. 
Life tears flow though
a whole new ghoulish
apparition, a vision
of homelessness plastered
east of Dearborn Bridge,
near Lower Wacker Drive,
downtown Chicago-
where affluent citizens
seldom go unless inebriated;
puke-stained, or in a taxicab. 

Jesse's hair sprouts skyward,
groomed like an abandoned
dove nest in wild Chicago
meandering winds. 
Puffed eye bags of weariness
sag likes sandbags,
one slightly heavier than the other.
Weeks of breaded growth
contour his chin in color blends
of white and black. 
Over one shoulder drapes
a grungy gray blanket found
in Lilly Mae's garbage can,
the other shoulder,
naked, but tanned,
bears itself to the elements. 
Jesse panhandles during the day.
At night and early Sunday mornings,
you can find him behind
a local McDonalds,
near Cracker Creek,
sharing leftover burgers
and sugar candy
with river rats-
Jesse considers it an act of religious charity; 
age 69, someday soon, Jesse wants to go home.

  <h3>by Marc Carver</h3>
<pre>
I walked into the coffee shop
The big black man was there
and we talked about the weather.
He stopped talking
and i moved on.

I ordered a coffee
and i began to chat to the man there as well.
"Do you realize between us we are half the gospels."
He thought about it for a while.
"Yea, i guess we are."
"Hopefully you will remember that little ditty. It has made your day memorable."
"Yea, most people tell me star wars jokes."

I grabbed my coffee from the oldish biggish woman.
"Thank you, you are a beautiful lady."
"I just serve coffee." She said.
I sat down
and stared out the window, looked at some women.
Then finished my coffee and walked out.

My sister has goats,<br />

  <h3>by Jeffrey Wyatt</h3>
<pre>
Beautiful form
daring to rise;
Flowering morning;
Sailing at sunrise.

Best of the rest,
Crest adorning.
Gathered with zest,
liberation soaring.

Then suddenly plucked
From streets of Tehran
Blossuming amuck
protesting Iran.

Words of freedom choked
gasping from throat;
Murdered scapegoat,
falling alone.

Neda Boltan,
blade of grass,
made enrollment
cut from masses,

a martyr arranged.
Another hardline Basij
catalyst for change--
a security service specialty:

Ahmadinejad's especially.

<div data-role="content">  <h2>No Engine Brake</h2>
  <h3>by Scott Urban</h3>
<pre>
 Twenty years ago
		I would have spat curses
		if I had to tap my brakes
		on a state route heading
		into a town no more than
		three hundred yards long – 
		  Mount Pleasant,
		   Ilesboro,
		     Ewing –
		delaying me by fifteen seconds
		on the way to meet my girlfriend,
		attend a concert,
		get back to school.

		Today I welcome any chance
		to slow that hurtle
		so I can savor road names like

		  Clay Lick
		   Honey Fork
		     Goat Run

		I even drive below the speed limit
		so that I can pick out
		
		  the angle between the spokes
		  of the wagon wheel sunk in the yard

		   the names of everyone in town
		   on mailboxes nailed to a single two-by-four
		
		     the hand-carved sign over the driveway
		     that reads “Ya’all come back now”
		
		      the curl of the ram’s horn
		      behind the chain-link fence at the corner.
		
		I know it won’t be long
		until I, too, sit on a sagging couch
		on a swayback porch
		and wave to angsty drivers
		who barrel too fast down the road
		on their way to a destination
		they can’t wait to leave and 
		won’t recall in less than a week.

  <h3>by Karen Finnigan</h3>
<pre>
Solitude is a dark cupboard,
a rusted lock, no key out.
Small talk is a latticework of frantic
lips framing gilded tongues in many mouths. 
My need for full communion
arrives only after party guests retreat. 
That’s when words sneak out from isolation, 
steal up behind and,
warmed by the quiet,
melt off the pen like
ice gone liquid at last.
In those moments, syllables seem
less ordinary wafer
than wine poured red
into a cup
too small and ready
after long confinement
for the soul to tincture.
I put the faucet on slow drip
to prevent a fatal
burst.

<div data-role="content">  <h2>Stuttgart Recollected</h2>
  <h3>by Gary Beck</h3>
<pre>
Remembered with a clarity,
a dervish-swirl vision,
the myth seen at midnight,
the mysterious Schlossplatz
and it’s castle of enchantment,
constructed before democracy.
The surrounding streets were silent,
but in the distance I could hear
the voices of American soldiers,
cursing, mostly in southern drawls,
and a mad cry rising above them,
the lament of a defeated relic,
raving in the night about Hitler:
"Adolf Hitler war mein freund,"
ignored by passersby
on the war-ravaged, rebuilt streets
of supine, resentful Germany,
that avoided total destruction
and allowed survivors
twisted by hopes of resurrection
to spin illusions of the past,
bewildering too many tomorrows
with convenient forgettings
that absolve the hills of Stuttgart
from renouncing beauty.

I remember one harsh night
sitting alone and broke
in the squalid Stuttgart Banhof,
hungry and fatigued,
without cigarettes or hope,
the after midnight drear
throttling my diminished expectations,
my soul eroded by failure,
as I sat at comfortless table
listening to the German waiters
talk to the Italian untermenschen
as if they were children.

One brash, young Italian,
resplendent in a flannel shirt,
bounced buoyantly around the waiting room babbling to anyone who noticed in his search for attention.
He pranced and posed
for a tired, aging whore
sitting with his countrymen,
hoping for late night business.
He smiled, sneered, snickered
in sly pursuit that she ignored,
scorning his childish allure,
but no one else responded,
so she left with him.

I no longer know
if the wind still blows the leaves
along the sculpted paths
of Stuttgart schloss,
slick with winter frost
covering the pools where goldfish swam
in more peaceful times,
now abandoned for warmer climes,
leaving turgid, tarnished water
beneath the frigid surface
that cannot compel the brief day’s sunlight to oblige the palace with the thaw of spring.

  <div data-role="content"><h2>Tired</h2>
  <h3>by Robert S. Martin</h3>
<pre>
I dreamed that I had quit my job,
laid in bed, unshaven.
I no longer wanted to do
the things I had done--
the mortgage,
the car,
not one more decision.
I can’t do one more thing.
I can’t even decide
what kind of bread to buy
at the grocery store--
sliced, unsliced,
buns, rye, poppy seeds,
discounted,
to use the coupons,
the too many batteries,
AA, AAA’s, longer, cheaper, better,
they place them at the checkout counter
where I am the weakest,
after all the decisions I have made
that have yet
to make me happy,
and when I go home,
even the cat rubs up against me
making demands,
I will not do it.
I refuse to pull her tail one more time.
