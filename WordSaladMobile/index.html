    <h2>Welcome to Word Salad Poetry Magazine</h2>
    <h2>Volume XVIII, No. I - Summer/Fall 2012</h2>
    <h3>Dear Word Salad Faithful --</h3>
    <p> It is with great humility that I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Fall/Winter edition (Volume XVII, No. III) of Word Salad Poetry Magazine. This edition not only is the send-off issue celebrating the highest quality of work for the last quarter of 2011, and with that being said, the proverbial kick-off to a fruitful new year, but it is also the first issue in which I have collaborated with Bruce Whealton and Jean Arthur Jones as an editorial staff member and online publisher, which as you may have guessed was a rather eventful experience.</p>
    <p> Since my discovery of Word Salad back in 2009, I’ve come to really notice its thriving community of writers, and in its maturity, I’ve noticed that a bulk of current projects have been collaborated by the staple poets. The degrees of loyalty from Word Salad contributors are similar to the attributes of loyalties common in family members, and so the Word Salad community is like the uprooting of a family tree: with each fruitful branch a contribution.</p>
    <p> This is more than just your run of the mill publication. Having been a loyal contributor for the past three years, it was this genealogical model that has kept me a follower.</p>
    <p> Through Word Salad I discovered other online journals, and coincidentally share publications with the likes of Scott Urban, Jean Jones, John M. Marshall and Alexis Child (just to name a few) on different platforms. In spite of several other publications, it’s hard to withdraw from the connectivity I have felt with Word Salad staff members and its contributors. My energy circumnavigates back to the place where my career took off.</p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Please, if you attach your poems in an email, please put all poems and cover letter into one file.&nbsp; We would prefer that to getting 3, 4 and 5 different files attache for each submission.&nbsp; Just put all 3 to 6 poems in one file.&nbsp;</li>
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>You can upload a file in rich text format (RTF), PDF or Open Office format ODT - <strong><em>preferably rich text format.</em></strong> &nbsp; <strong><em>Note, most word processors, such as MS Word will let you save your file as rich text format, rtf.&nbsp; An rtf (rich text format) file can be read by any word processor and that's why we prefer this most!</em></strong></li>
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>We <strong>must have a valid email address</strong> and name/pen name or we cannot use your poetry submission(s).</li>
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Please also read the poems written by the staff and the other poems posted here on this site to get an idea as to the kind of poems we publish.</li>
      <li>We would ask that you include your name in the file name if you are submitting your poems as an attachment and it is preferable to remove spaces in the file name.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for example, if I was submitting a set of poems, I'd name the file BruceWhealtonPoetrySubmissionWordSalad.rtf or I&nbsp; could use BruceWhealtonSubmission.rtf</li>
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>We won't be very, very picky, if you don't follow each and every guideline to the letter.&nbsp; The prior bullet point is just a suggestion that makes it easier for me to keep track of submissions and who submitted what.</li>
