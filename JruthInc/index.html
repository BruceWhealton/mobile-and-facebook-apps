<p>Johnetta Ruth Allen Alston, a 48 year-old mother and grandmother is a native of Durham, North Carolina. In founding, organizing, and maintaining several community service programs throughout Durham, Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Butner, Ms. Alston has made it her life’s work to advocate for those in the community who cannot advocate for themselves including homeless, transient, ex-offender, veteran, and low income men and women. She has received education at Rutledge College (Business/Accounting), North Carolina Central University (Business/Accounting), and Durham <a id="FALINK_2_0_1" href="http://jruthinc.org/community/node/8#">Technical</a> Community College (Business). With this formal training, as well as, over 1700 instructional hours and practical community work experience in both the non-profit (Few Gardens Community Center, Secretary) and private sectors (Central Carolina Bank, Head Vault Teller; GTE/Verizon—Management/Associate).  Ms. Alston gained the skills necessary to fulfill her vision of helping individuals and families in need become productive, educated, and most importantly, motivated to work and live in their community. Out of this vision, JRuth, Inc. was founded in 2002.</p>

<p>Ms. Alston serves as the Executive Director of JRuth, Inc., a non-profit 501(C)3 organization that assists those in need through four programs: 1. Self Sufficiency (the educational component); 2. Rental Housing Placement (JRuth Manor); 3. Employment; and 4. Home Ownership. In addition to these programs, JRuth Manor was established in November 2007, opening its doors to individuals and families in transition whose goal is to promote the culture of family.</p>

<p>In conjunction with JRuth, Inc., Ms. Alston is a training coach and instructor for Durham Technical Community College, where she successfully teaches Life Skills, Financial Literacy, and Employability Skills within Durham, Butner and Orange Counties as well as in Federal Correctional Facilities.

Camp is also available to the Hispanic population.</p>

<p>Ms. Alston’s endeavors are made possible by her grant certification through HUD, and she is the recipient of several local and state awards, including the City of Durham’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), the City of Raleigh’s Community Service Grant, IBM and Commerce Bank—New York.
